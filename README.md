# Face-Detection
### The purpose of this project is to allow users to upload a photo and analyze facial recognition and facial expressions. The project uses face recognition technology to detect faces in the image, encircle them, and identify emotional expressions (such as happy, sad, angry, etc.). Users can tag their friends on the detected faces, creating a social media-like experience. Additionally, users can share the photo along with text, tagging their friends based on the detected facial expressions. In this way, the project offers an interactive social media experience with advanced technologies like facial recognition and emotion analysis.
